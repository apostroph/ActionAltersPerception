received his Bachelor degree in Electronics and Industrial Computer Science. In September 2012, he got his masters' degree in Intelligent System Engineering from Toulouse 3 University, during which he researched on the emergence of the mirror neurons systems. In October 2012, he started a PhD course in Cognitive Robotics at the Osaka University in which he attended to several exchange courses in Germany and in Italy. His research interest is to understand the emergence of pro-social behavior in young infants and to create robots able to develop similar abilities.

is a Specially Appointed Associate Professor at Osaka University, Japan. She received her Ph.D. in Engineering from Osaka University in 2004 and worked as a postdoc researcher at National Institute of Information and Communications Technology in Kyoto from 2004 to 2006. She then worked at Bielefeld University, Germany for three and a half years until she started her current position at Osaka University in October 2009. Her research interests include the developmental mechanism of human social cognition such as self-other cognition, imitation, joint attention, and cooperation. She has been investigating the underlying mechanisms for cognitive development by means of constructive approaches.
