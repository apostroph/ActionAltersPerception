\begin{abstract}
The perception of others' motions as goal directed actions has been shown to emerge in infants as they become able to manipulate their environments. Hence, it has been shown though infant studies that the perception of action can be altered 3-months-old toddler by allowing them to interact with object using sticky mittens.

\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item Sommerville et al., 2005 \cite{Sommerville2005} Action experience alters 3-month-old infants' perception of others' actions.
\item Gerson et al., 2014 \cite{gerson2014learning} Results revealed a unique effect of active over observational experience. Furthermore, findings suggest that benefits of trained actions do not generalize broadly, at least following brief training.
\end{itemize}

\section{Hypothesis 1: Perception via Action} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Meltzoff \cite{meltzoff2007like} Infants represent the acts of others and their own acts in commensurate terms. They can recognize cross-modal equivalences between acts they see others perform and their own felt bodily movements. 
\item Minoto et al., 2010 \cite{Minato2012} The simulated infants are able to develop the components of a healthy body mapping in order, that is, relating self motion first, followed by an understanding of others’ motions, which is supported by psychological studies.
\end{itemize}

\section{Hypothesis 2: Attention Model}

\begin{itemize}
\item Kidd et al., 2012 \cite{Kidd2012} Human infants allocate attention to visual sequences that are neither too simple nor too complex.
\item Nagai et al., 2015 \cite{nagai2015model} Infants have a fixed preference function: higher for a moderate prediction error, and lower for a smaller/larger prediction error.
\end{itemize}

received his Bachelor degree in Electronics and Industrial Computer Science. In September 2012, he got his masters' degree in Intelligent System Engineering from Toulouse 3 University, during which he researched on the emergence of the mirror neurons systems. In October 2012, he started a PhD course in Cognitive Robotics at the Osaka University in which he attended to several exchange courses in Germany and in Italy. His research interest is to understand the emergence of pro-social behavior in young infants and to create robots able to develop similar abilities.

is a Specially Appointed Associate Professor at Osaka University, Japan. She received her Ph.D. in Engineering from Osaka University in 2004 and worked as a postdoc researcher at National Institute of Information and Communications Technology in Kyoto from 2004 to 2006. She then worked at Bielefeld University, Germany for three and a half years until she started her current position at Osaka University in October 2009. Her research interests include the developmental mechanism of human social cognition such as self-other cognition, imitation, joint attention, and cooperation. She has been investigating the underlying mechanisms for cognitive development by means of constructive approaches.
